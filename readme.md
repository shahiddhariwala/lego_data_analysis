# LEGO Data Analysis

Welcome to the "LEGO Data Analysis" project! In this project, we will dive deep into a fascinating dataset all about LEGO. By analyzing this dataset, we will uncover interesting insights about the history of the LEGO company, their product offerings, and discover which LEGO set reigns supreme.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will cover the following key questions and topics:

1. **Most Enormous LEGO Set**: Discover the largest LEGO set ever created and find out how many parts it had.

2. **Early LEGO Sets**: Explore the year of the first LEGO sets' release and learn how many sets the company sold during its initial launch.

3. **Most Popular LEGO Theme**: Identify the LEGO theme with the highest number of sets. Will it be Harry Potter, Ninjago, Friends, or something entirely unexpected?

4. **LEGO Company Growth**: Determine the period when the LEGO company experienced significant growth based on its product offerings. Examine the number of themes and sets released each year.

5. **Size and Complexity of LEGO Sets**: Investigate whether LEGO sets have grown in size and complexity over time. Compare the number of parts in older LEGO sets versus newer sets.

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this project, you will gain hands-on experience with various data analysis techniques and tools. Here are some of the skills and concepts you will learn:

- Combining a Notebook with HTML Markup to enhance your analysis.

- Applying Python List slicing techniques to Pandas DataFrames.

- Aggregating data using the `.agg()` function to derive meaningful insights.

- Creating visually appealing scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts with two axes using Matplotlib.

- Understanding database schemas organized by primary and foreign keys.

- Merging DataFrames that share a common key to integrate data from different sources.
